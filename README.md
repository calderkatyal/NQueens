# NQueens
This is a simple project in Java that takes in a natural number N from the user and determines whether it is possible to place N queens on an N x N board such that no two queens can capture each other. If so, it outputs an N x N array where 1's correspond to queens; otherwise, it informs the user that the task is impossible.
